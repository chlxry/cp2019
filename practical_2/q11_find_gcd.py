# A solution to find the greatest common divisor of two integers n1 and n2 is as follows: 
# First find d to be the minimum of n1 and n2, 
# then check whether d, d-1, â€¦ d-2, 2, or 1 is a divisor for both n1 and n2 in this order. 
# The first such common divisor is the greatest common divisor for n1 and n2. Write a program to implement this solution.
