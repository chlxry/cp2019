# The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers m and n, gcd(m, n) can be defined recursively as follows: 

# If m % n is 0, gcd(m, n) is n.
# Otherwise, gcd(m, n) is gcd(n, m % n).

# Write a recursive function gcd(m, n) to find the GCD. Write a test program that computes gcd(24, 16) and gcd(255, 25).
